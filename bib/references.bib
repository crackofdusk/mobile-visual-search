	year = {2011},
	month = {05/2011},
	abstract = {Establishing visual correspondences is an essential component of many computer vision problems, which is often done with local feature-descriptors. Transmission and storage of these descriptors are of critical importance in the context of mobile visual search applications. We propose a framework for computing low bit-rate feature descriptors with a 20{\texttimes} reduction in bit rate compared to state-of-the-art descriptors. The framework offers low complexity and has significant speed-up in the matching stage. We show how to efficiently compute distances between descriptors in the compressed domain eliminating the need for decoding. We perform a comprehensive performance comparison with SIFT, SURF, BRIEF, MPEG-7 image signatures and other low bit-rate descriptors and show that our proposed CHoG descriptor outperforms existing schemes significantly over a wide range of bitrates. We implement the descriptor in a mobile image retrieval system and for a database of 1 million CD, DVD and book covers, we achieve 96\% retrieval accuracy using only 4 KB of data per query image.},
