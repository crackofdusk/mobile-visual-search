\section{Conclusion}

The report discussed state-of-the-art methodology of visual information retrieval. Every section presents techniques which ensure the level of efficiency desirable for mobile visual search.

The Fast Hessian feature detector uses approximations to simplify computations and thus make them fast even on devices with low processing power.

The Compressed Histogram of Gradients feature descriptor is both memory and bandwidth friendly: it does not require storing a codebook on the device which computes the descriptor and it produces low bitrate descriptors which is a big gain considering the lattency challenges of mobile devices.

The feature matching step yields match candidates with a small number of operations thanks to, on the one hand, the hierarchical nature of the vocabulary tree and, on the other hand, the inverted indexes attached to the vocabulary tree.

Finally, the fast filtering of candidate images by means of geometric re-ranking and then ratio tests ensures that only a small number of candidates will be left for consistency checking by Random Sample Consensus. Again, this reduces the server response time.
