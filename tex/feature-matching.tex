\section{Feature matching}

A method called compressed domain matching [TODO: reference] is used to achieve fast matching. The distances between different distributions are computed and stored in a lookup table. The quantized histogram indexes serves as indexes to this lookup table. Thus, no decompression is required in order to compare two descriptors.
